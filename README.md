## Object measurement in photos for industrial use:

This mini project came as a request from an USA Silicon Valley space startup which wanted to measure some objects which were the results of industrial production (bound by agreement: I can't disclose more).

The purpose was to detect product shape changes under different circumstances.

Using Computer Vision cv2, I have adapted a standard practice of object measurement in photos for an environment where the setup (background, lighting and position of the object) was the same and there was NO known reference object size. It does calculate the surface area and can be modeled further for more particular object sizes: cubes, spheres, elipses, tubes, etc.

Hope this helps if you are looking for a customized .

Thank you,

Daniel
